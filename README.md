NoteParser
==========

A simple Python script to parse my Note Markup Language
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a Python script which will be able to be run on notes written in a Markdown-influenced markup language called Note Markup language, and turn them into whatever output I code it for. Initial versions will output HTML. This is not intended to be a major breakthrough in note-taking, just something interesting to code.

The eventual goal is to integrade this into [NoteVelocity](http://www.github.com/Luxtylo/NoteVelocity) to format notes as they are typed, so I will be coding it with live refresh (after a 5-character buffer fills up or something) in mind.

Dependencies

* Python >= 3
